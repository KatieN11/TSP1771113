      <h3>how your music has given me a home</h3>

    <p>
      If I have learned anything from being a swiftie, it is that every person
      who listens to your songs can take vastly different things away from the
      same lyrics. But, your music also spreads common themes, bridges gaps
      between people,and allows so many people to find unity in a sphere of
      endless loneliness. The community I found in this fandom is something I am
      endlessly grateful for, and I cannot imagine my life without it. I once
      tried to be the classic 'swifite', the one who - when people thought of
      Taylor Swift - they would think of me (this is a long rabbithole of a
      story). However, I found that all the special experiences I have had as a
      “swiftie ” would be mitigated without the people I have shared them with.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the day, being a swiftie is not about who listens to the
      most music, or who knows the most niche easter eggs, but rather the
      friendships with people across the world I rekindled due to a shared
      interest: the ones who I text and watch every grainy livestream with. It’s
      about when my sister and I tested our hair, outfits, and makeup ideas the
      day before our first Eras Tour show in Cincinnati, more excited than ever.
      It’s about talking my friends’ ears off about you or your music, making
      them watch ‘Miss Americana’ and ‘The Reputation Stadium Tour’. It’s
      watching the Chiefs with my dad every week and growing to understand and
      love football. It’s making bracelets and trading them to people I don’t
      know. It’s taking a photo with the girl I met on the floor at the
      Cincinnati Eras Tour show who also had a dexcom for type 1 diabetes
      management- like me. It’s meeting people and learning about them, and
      watching the Grammys and VMAS with them. Its clowning about releases and
      listening to new songs: TTPD, The Speak Now vault tracks, the 1989 vault
      tracks, and so much more. It's really about learning to appreciate the
      people in the community the way I appreciate you.
    </p>

      To me, it doesn’t matter when someone became a fan, it only matters how we
      can come together to support one another and how your art has provided the
      ground for so many people to come together in a safe space, a home. Our
      fandom is far from perfect, like any fandom is, but there are some really
      special people I have found becuase of you - some of my best friends. It’s
      these people and this home that allows me to truly let go and live life
      (The trick to holding on, you could say). This safe space has given me the
      confidence to go to the move theater in a full costume to watch the Eras
      Tour movie. But, it has also given me a world to fall back on when I lost
      a friend, a place where I could admit that I had been hurt and had hurt
      her, too. Your music provides a support system created by an intersection
      of beautifully unique and collective experiences that makes up our fandom.
      A group of people coming together over connecting to your music so deeply.
      Thank you again for that.

          Tara is one of my internet friends. She lives in Norway and loves you
          just as much as I do. She went to Amsterdam N1, planned to go to
          Vienna N1 and N2, and London N8. We reconnected over your music.
